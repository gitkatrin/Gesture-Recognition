# Gesture-Recognition
my project in "Interaktionskonzept"




How can users interact with displays using gesture recognition?
* What kind of gesture would be necessary for this interaction?
* Can we add new gestures?
* Can we share knowledge with other cars?
* Implement an use case that can recognize 3 gestures.
* Input: Video (could be webacam)
* Output: name of the gesture
* One gesture should make a request to the server (calling police).
